### Notes from CTCI
1. Ask Questions
2. Design Algorithm ( recommend to start with brute force -> then optimize )
3. Pseudocode ( Outline your thoughts)
4. Code
5. Test ( 1 Edge cases : negative, null, min, max )

      (   2 General cases )


## Five Algorithm Approaches
1. Examplify -> start writing test examples
2. Pattern Matching
3. Simplify
4. Base case and build
5. Data structure and brainstorm

## How To Practice a Question
1. Try to solve your own
2. Write the code algorithm on paper
3. Test your code
4. Type your paper code into computer.

When solving problems, create a list to track mistakes you've made solving problems.

Before interview day, review the list of mistakes you usually made.
